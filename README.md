This consists of color recongnition model using tensorflow and SVM 
There are folders named 'red','green','blue' which contains the images of training dataset

There is a folder named "using_tensorflow" which has a color recongnition using tensorflow DNN classifier
  The first python file "create_dataset" creates a csv file with the pixel values for each training image.Here in the class column 0=red      color 1=green 2=blue   
  The second program is the code for the  model to recongnize the color.
 **Note:This requires the tensorflow 1.14.0 version**
