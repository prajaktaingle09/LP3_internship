There are folders named 'red','green','blue' which contains the images of training dataset.<br />

There is a folder named "using_tensorflow" which has a color recongnition using tensorflow DNN classifier.<br />
  The first python file "create_dataset" creates a csv file with the pixel values for each training image.Here in the class column 0=red      color 1=green 2=blue   <br />
  The second program is the code for the  model to recongnize the color.<br />
